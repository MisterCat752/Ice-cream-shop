As a developer for an ice cream shop website, my primary goal would be to create an engaging and user-friendly website that reflects the fun and inviting atmosphere of the shop. The website would need to be visually appealing with bright colors and high-quality images of the various ice cream flavors and treats available.

To ensure a seamless user experience, the website would be designed with responsive web design principles, allowing customers to easily browse and order from the site on any device, whether it be a desktop computer, tablet, or mobile phone.
